# Longest Palindromic Subsequence using Dynamic Programming

# Function to find the length of Longest Palindromic Subsequence
# of substring X[i..j]
def longestPalindrome(X, i, j):

	# base condition
	if i > j:
		return 0

	# if X has only one character, it is palindrome
	if i == j:
		return 1

	# if last character of the string is same as the first character
	if X[i] == X[j]:
		# include first and last characters in palindrome
		# and recur for the remaining substring X[i+1, j-1]
		return longestPalindrome(X, i + 1, j - 1) + 2

	# if last character of string is different to the first character

	# 1. Remove last character & recur for the remaining substring X[i, j-1]
	# 2. Remove first character & recur for the remaining substring X[i+1, j]
	# return maximum of the two values
	return max(longestPalindrome(X, i, j - 1), longestPalindrome(X, i + 1, j))
